The files are organized as follows:
* First line: Number of nodes n, number of arcs m, unused, unused (for future extensions), number N of sets T_k.
* For each node i=1,...,n a line with the number of outgoing arcs from the node i.
* For each node i=1,...,n, and for each arc (i,j) \in A a line with the label j and the cost of the arc.
* A line with the source node.
* A line with the destination node.
* For each T_k, k=1,...,N, a line with: the numbers of nodes in T_k and the list of nodes belonging to T_k.
